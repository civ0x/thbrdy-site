Product leader who builds infrastructure at the boundary where AI research becomes reliable. At AWS, took research from concept to shipped products (Neptune ML, first LLM strategy, Neuron SDK) by working directly with researchers to identify which capabilities had real-world potential. At H2O.ai, led product strategy for the core AutoML portfolio. Currently prototyping daily with Claude Code — built an iOS app in 3 days, developed interactive research tools, and authored original research on AI coordination infrastructure. The through-line: I find where implicit structure — expertise locked in specialists' heads, dependency relationships no one has mapped, coordination assumptions no one has tested — is the bottleneck, and I build products that make it explicit and navigable. Before tech, 15 years in national security (Special Forces, Senate defense policy) doing the same thing in environments where structural misreads have immediate consequences.
