# Session Prompt: Add Learning Entry to Now Page

## Situation

The `/now` page (`src/pages/now.astro`) has one entry ("Rebuilding 'What Is Code?'"). Thomas wants to add a second entry about his current learning schedule: two parallel courses that feed into the Scholion prototype.

## Mission

Add a new dated entry about the dual-course learning plan. Place it **above** the existing "What Is Code?" entry (newest first). No style changes needed — the existing `.now-entry` styles apply.

## Changes

### File: `src/pages/now.astro`

Insert the following `<article>` block **after** the `<p class="last-updated">` line and **before** the existing `<article class="now-entry">` for "What Is Code?":

```html
    <article class="now-entry">
      <time class="entry-date" datetime="2026-02-24">Week of 24 Feb</time>
      <h2 class="entry-title">Two Courses, One Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        I'm running two courses in parallel, both aimed at the same target: a working
        <a href="/writing/scholion/">Scholion</a> prototype — a web app that ingests scientific papers,
        extracts claim-dependency graphs (Toulmin structure: claims, warrants, backings, and their relationships),
        and lets you navigate them interactively.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://solve.it.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Solve It with Code</a>
        provides the application stack: FastHTML/HTMX for the UI, a PDF ingestion pipeline, LLM-prompted extraction,
        and Pólya-based problem decomposition as a working method.
        <a href="https://course.fast.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a>
        provides the model-layer understanding for when prompting hits its ceiling — eventually fine-tuning a smaller model
        on labeled data generated by the LLM extraction pipeline (the LLM-as-labeler pattern).
      </p>
      <p>
        For fast.ai I'm running a speed-run: prioritize the NLP lesson, collaborative filtering (for embedding intuition),
        tabular/random forest (for claim classification baselines), and Part&nbsp;2's transformer and attention content.
        Computer vision lectures get skimmed at 2x for pedagogical patterns; the deployment and ethics lectures are skipped
        (deployment is covered by SolveIt, ethics I've engaged with elsewhere).
      </p>
      <p>
        The daily schedule runs eight hours in four blocks. Mornings: three hours on courses —
        30&nbsp;minutes of paper reading (which doubles as Scholion test data),
        90&nbsp;minutes on How to Solve It, 60&nbsp;minutes on fast.ai.
        The 2:1 ratio reflects that SolveIt produces the working artifact while fast.ai builds understanding that pays off later.
        Midday: a one-hour buffer for reading, integration work, or overflow.
        Afternoons: two hours on other projects (Notice, thbrdy.dev), two hours on job search.
        The Scholion prototype built through the courses is also the strongest portfolio artifact —
        these aren't competing priorities, they converge.
      </p>
    </article>
```

**Important:** The existing "What Is Code?" `<article>` stays exactly as-is, immediately after this new block. The `:first-of-type` CSS rule will now apply to this new entry (no top border), and the "What Is Code?" entry will get the separator border automatically.

## Note on the Scholion Link

The entry links to `/writing/scholion/` — if that essay slug doesn't exist yet, the link will 404. This is intentional forward-linking. If it should point elsewhere (or be plain text for now), adjust before executing.

## Verification

- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] `/now` shows two entries: "Two Courses, One Prototype" first, "Rebuilding 'What Is Code?'" second
- [ ] A subtle border separates the two entries
- [ ] Links to SolveIt (solve.it.com) and fast.ai (course.fast.ai) open in new tabs
- [ ] Scholion link points to `/writing/scholion/`
- [ ] All prose renders in Cormorant Garamond, dates/labels in JetBrains Mono
- [ ] No new JS dependencies added
- [ ] Mobile: both entries wrap cleanly
