## Close Friends

These are people who know you well, know your work ethic, and will respond to directness.

> Hey — I've been heads-down on something and wanted to loop you in. Over the past year I've been building a body of work around a single idea: making invisible structures visible and navigable. That's shown up as a few different projects — a tool for tracking how scientific claims depend on each other (Scholion), a series of published essays on how we actually learn, and most recently an Apple Watch app called Notice that helps people develop body awareness using sensors and AI.
>
> Everything's published at thbrdy.dev — working prototypes, the research behind them, all of it. Right now I'm pushing Notice toward launch and trying to pull together about $5K from people I trust to cover infrastructure costs. No strings, no equity — just a gift to help me get this across the line.

## Family

Warmer, a bit more context on what you're doing and why, since they may not track your professional life closely.

> Hey — wanted to share what I've been pouring my time into. I've been building a set of projects that all connect to one idea: helping people see structures that are normally invisible. One of them maps how scientific arguments actually hold together. Another is a series of essays about how learning really works. And the one I'm closest to launching is an app called Notice — it's for the Apple Watch and iPhone, and it helps you tune into what's happening in your body throughout the day. Stress patterns, energy shifts, that kind of thing. It draws on the meditation and awareness practices I've been doing for years, combined with the watch's sensors and AI.
>
> I've got a working prototype and I'm pushing toward a real launch. I'm covering most of the costs myself, but I'm trying to raise about $5K from people close to me to help with the technical infrastructure to get it out the door.
>
> This isn't an investment — just a gift to support the work. Anything helps, even small amounts. And if the timing isn't right, totally fine.

## Professional Contacts / Acquaintances

People who respect you professionally but where the relationship is less personal. Slightly more structured, emphasizes the substance.

> Hey [name] — reaching out because I wanted to share what I've been building. I've been working under the thesis "making invisible structures visible and navigable" — that's produced Scholion (claim-dependency tracking for scientific reasoning), a set of published essays on learning and expertise, and most recently Notice, an Apple Watch app for developing interoceptive awareness using on-device AI and sensor data.
>
> The research and prototypes are all published at thbrdy.dev. Right now I'm pushing Notice toward launch and pulling together a small amount — $5K total — from people in my network to cover infrastructure costs. Not equity, not an investment — just people backing the work.
>
> If that's something you'd want to be part of, I'd appreciate it. If not, no worries — happy just to have you tracking what I'm up to.

## Notes

- **Payment method:** Decide how you want to receive funds (Venmo, Zelle, check, wire) and include that in your message or follow-up.
- **Tracking:** Keep a simple record of who gave what and when. You'll want this for your own bookkeeping and in case you decide to grant equity later.
- **Follow-up:** Anyone who gives should get periodic updates on progress. Even a brief "here's where things stand" every few weeks goes a long way.
- **Don't mass-send.** Personalize each message. Use the templates as a starting point, not a mail merge.
