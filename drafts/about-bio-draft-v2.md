I'm from a small town in North Carolina. My first real job was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — I was eighteen, still in college, working as a research analyst on Asia-Pacific policy for Chairman Jesse Helms. Helms was our senator, and that's how things worked. I was studying Chinese, and in 2000 I took a semester at Peking University — traveling to Lhasa, Tibet while I was there.

On September 11, 2001, my apartment was across the highway from the Pentagon. It filled with smoke from the attack. A month later, my office building was the one in the anthrax attack — shuttered for six months while they remediated. The world I'd been analyzing from committee hearing rooms had come home.

After 9/11, I went to work for Sam Brownback — stood up the Central Asia Caucus, became his foreign policy advisor. I traveled to Azerbaijan, Turkey, Israel, Thailand, India, Nepal, and Nigeria. In April 2003, I was an election observer for Nigeria's presidential election. Over those six years on the Hill, I got an education in how power actually moves through institutions: not through org charts, but through relationships, information asymmetries, and the stories people tell themselves about what they're doing.

In December 2004, a Congressional staff trip took me to Dharamsala, India. I met the Dalai Lama. Something about that encounter stayed with me — not as a practice yet, but as a question. The idea that the mind could be studied from the inside with the same rigor you'd bring to any other system. It would take another fifteen years before I sat down to actually do it.

After Dharamsala, I went to the Defense Intelligence Agency as a China strategic analyst, writing assessments of Chinese military leadership for senior defense officials. It was good work. But the world had changed, and I'd changed with it. So I did something that made no sense on paper: at twenty-five, I quit the DIA and enlisted in the United States Army with the intent of joining Special Forces.

Basic training. Airborne school. Special Forces Assessment and Selection. Then the two-year qualification pipeline — I trained as an 18 Echo, a Special Forces communications sergeant: satellite systems, radio theory, cryptography, and a year of intensive Mandarin Chinese — my assigned language, which I'd been studying since college. In 2007, I deployed to Iraq with 1st Special Forces Group. After Iraq and a JCET to Nepal, I cross-trained as an 18 Fox — intelligence sergeant — and in 2010 spent nine months on the island of Jolo in the Philippines, which was as wild as it sounds.

Special Forces taught me something the Senate hadn't. Systems under real pressure reveal their actual structure. The doctrine, the org chart, the plan — those are approximations. What matters is the dependency structure underneath: who needs what from whom, what breaks first, and what you do when it does. *Slow is smooth, smooth is fast* isn't a slogan. It's an epistemological claim about how complex systems behave.

I left the Army at thirty-four. Went back to the University of Washington, finished my degree in international studies, picked up Chinese again, and played rugby. My buddy Shane — a former Ranger — and I collected our share of black eyes. Then, needing to find a job, I went back to the Senate one more time. This time as a defense policy advisor for Senator Tom Cotton on the Armed Services Committee. I traveled across Asia again — Korea, Taiwan, Singapore — and was part of some of the biggest national security debates of the mid-2010s.

Then I left Washington for good and moved back to Seattle. The technology chapter started at AWS, where I went from solutions architecture to product management for ML research — helping shape early LLM efforts alongside researchers like Alex Smola and George Karypis, launching Neptune ML, driving the turnaround of what became the Neuron SDK. Then H2O.ai, leading product for their core ML portfolio. In both places, the same pattern: the hardest problem was never the technology. It was making the invisible dependencies between research, engineering, and market legible to the people who needed to act on them.

In 2022 I left H2O.ai. After twenty years of working more or less nonstop — the Senate, Special Forces, Iraq, the Philippines, the Senate again, AWS, H2O — I needed to stop. I started building my own thing, which eventually became Pando Industries.

Then in 2024, severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis put me in the ICU. Four months hospitalized. Twenty-four blood transfusions. Dialysis. I lost a hundred pounds.

I came out lighter — in every sense.

Now I build tools. [Scholion](/writing/scholion/) maps epistemic dependencies in scientific reasoning. [Notice](/notice/) trains interoceptive awareness through the Apple Watch. Both make invisible structures visible and navigable — which, I've come to realize, is what I've been doing in every chapter, whether the structure was a policy network, a military operation, an ML pipeline, or my own mind.

The seed that was planted in Dharamsala finally took root about five years ago. I meditate daily now. I'm not a scholar of Buddhism, but the practice has become central to how I think — and how I build. Studying the mind from the inside turns out to be the same kind of work as mapping dependencies in a research paper or tracking states on a watch face: making invisible structures visible, and learning what happens when you see them clearly.

I still play rugby. I like hiking and camping. I live in Oakland.

## Notes on photo treatment

- Photos should feel like documentary moments, not corporate headshots
- Captions in JetBrains Mono, small, --text-muted — location and year only, no explanations
- The military section uses a 2-up cluster (Philippines + Iraq) to avoid visual domination
- The hospitalization photo should be smaller/inset — intimate, not heroic
- The "today" photo anchors the ending with visual weight
- Consider a subtle warm wash or consistent treatment to unify photos spanning 25 years of camera quality
- The sepia Iraq turret photo is the strongest military image — use it as the lead for that section

## Design notes

- No section dividers (01 — Path, etc.) — photos ARE the section breaks
- Page meta description: "The long way around to making invisible structures visible."
- Resume PDF hosted at /thomas-brady-resume.pdf or /resume.pdf
- Instruments/Marks/Lineage sections eliminated — absorbed into narrative or PDF
- The closing line ("I still play rugby...") grounds the whole thing — he's a person, not a thesis
- Consider whether "today" photo could double as a subtle page header/hero element

## Changes from v1

- Added 9/11 and anthrax — provides the "why" for enlisting. Stated as flat fact, no drama.
- Added Brownback chapter with specific travel (Azerbaijan, Turkey, Israel, etc.) and Nigeria election observer
- Added DIA as explicit step before enlistment, making the pivot clearer
- Named the enlistment age (25) and the specific decision ("quit the DIA and enlisted")
- Added Jolo specifically — anyone who knows the Philippines knows what that means
- Added 18F cross-training — he went from comms to intel
- Named Tom Cotton specifically for the Armed Services period
- Replaced "several weeks" with the real numbers: 4 months, ICU, 24 transfusions, dialysis, 100 lbs
- Named the condition: severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis
- Added the 2022 break context — 20 nonstop years
- Added closing human details: rugby, hiking, camping, San Francisco
- ~900 words of prose (up from ~600), but the story demanded it
