**[PHOTO: Senate Foreign Relations Committee group photo, 2001. Full width or near-full-width, with a quiet caption: "Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff, 2001."]**

I started in Washington. At twenty-two I was a research analyst on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, working Asia-Pacific policy for Chairman Jesse Helms. I'm from North Carolina — Helms was our senator, and that's how things worked. By twenty-five I was managing foreign policy portfolios, drafting legislation, coordinating across State, Commerce, and USAID. It was an education in how power actually moves through institutions: not through org charts, but through relationships, information asymmetries, and the stories people tell themselves about what they're doing.

In December 2004, a Congressional staff trip took me to Dharamsala, India. I met the Dalai Lama. I didn't know it at the time, but that trip planted something that would become the most important intellectual commitment of my life. The encounter with Tibetan Buddhism — its rigor, its phenomenological precision, its insistence that the mind can be studied from the inside — would take years to take root. But the seed was planted.

What happened next was that I enlisted in the Army.

**[PHOTO: Iraq turret photo (the sepia one — great composition, natural warmth). Full width. Caption: "Iraq, 2007. 1st Special Forces Group."]**

I went through Special Forces selection and the two-year qualification pipeline — Mandarin Chinese immersion, communications specialization, satellite systems, radio theory, cryptography. In 2007 I deployed to Iraq with 1st Special Forces Group as a fresh 18 Echo. I ran comms for combat missions, built antenna systems that exceeded equipment specs by 5x, and learned to keep complex systems working in places where nothing worked reliably.

**[PHOTO: Philippines — teaching sniper school. Warm, human. Caption: "Teaching sniper school, Philippines."]**

Later I taught sniper school to Filipino Marines and ran operations support across six Special Forces teams throughout Asia. Special Forces taught me something Senate work hadn't: that systems under real pressure reveal their actual structure. The doctrine, the org chart, the plan — those are approximations. What matters is the dependency structure underneath: who needs what from whom, what breaks first, and what you do when it does. *Slow is smooth, smooth is fast* isn't a slogan. It's an epistemological claim about how complex systems behave.

**[PHOTO: UW Rugby. The black eye, the grin. Caption: "University of Washington Rugby, 2013."]**

I got out of the Army at thirty-four, went back to school at the University of Washington, and played rugby. My buddy Shane — a former Ranger — and I collected our share of black eyes. I built UW's first seismic resiliency policy, then went back to the Senate, this time on Armed Services, with a decade of operational experience behind the policy questions. I helped reshape a $3 billion intelligence enterprise and guided Congressional investment in emerging defense technologies.

The technology chapter came next. At AWS, I worked on ML research-to-product translation — helping shape early LLM efforts alongside researchers like Alex Smola and George Karypis, launching Neptune ML, and driving the turnaround of what became the Neuron SDK. Then H2O.ai, leading product for their core ML portfolio. In both places, the same pattern: the hardest problem was never the technology. It was making the invisible dependencies between research, engineering, and market legible to the people who needed to act on them.

In late 2024, I was hospitalized for several weeks. I came out lighter — in every sense.

**[PHOTO: Today. The whiteboard, the cherry blossoms. Full width or hero-weight. Caption: "San Francisco, 2026."]**

Now I build tools. [Scholion](/writing/scholion/) maps epistemic dependencies in scientific reasoning. [Notice](/notice/) trains interoceptive awareness through the Apple Watch. Both make invisible structures visible and navigable — which, I've come to realize, is what I've been doing in every chapter, whether the structure was a policy network, a military operation, an ML pipeline, or my own mind.

The contemplative practice that started with that trip to Dharamsala is now the spine — twenty years of serious study in Theravāda and Vajrayāna Buddhism. It's not separate from the engineering work. It's the same investigation: what are the actual dependencies, and what happens when you see them clearly?

## Notes on photo treatment

- Photos should feel like documentary moments, not corporate headshots
- Captions in JetBrains Mono, small, --text-muted — location and year only, no explanations
- The Iraq and Philippines photos could work as a 2-up cluster (side by side) rather than sequential full-width, to keep the military section from dominating visually
- The hospitalization photo should be smaller than the others — it's intimate, not heroic
- The "today" photo anchors the ending and should have visual weight
- Consider a subtle warm wash or slight desaturation to unify photos that span 25 years of camera quality

## Design notes

- No section dividers (01 — Path, etc.) — the photos ARE the section breaks
- Page title could shift from "About" to just the name, or even drop the title entirely (the hero already says who he is)
- Keep the page description/meta: something like "The long way around to making invisible structures visible."
- Resume PDF hosted at /thomas-brady-resume.pdf (or similar)
- The Instruments/Marks/Lineage sections are gone — all absorbed into the narrative or the PDF
