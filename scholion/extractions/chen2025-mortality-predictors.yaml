  scope_note: >
    Extraction covers the mortality prediction argument chain: from
    inclusion criteria and study design through statistical analysis
    to the three independent mortality predictors. Chosen because it
    demonstrates a clean dependency chain in an empirical/statistical
    domain, structurally parallel to the RSP chain in the original
    Scholion essay but in clinical medicine.

      This is the foundational crux of the entire analysis. Every downstream

    notes: >
      Second crux in the chain. The choice to adjust only for age and
      gender (not comorbidities, COVID severity, or treatment) is a
      significant methodological decision. With n=111 and 11 deaths,
      the model has very limited statistical power for additional
      covariates (standard rule of thumb: ~10 events per covariate).
      This is a genuine constraint, not an oversight, but it limits
      causal interpretation.

# Crux analysis: If method.1 falls (induced/coincident distinction invalid),

# nodes. The individual predictor claims (mortality.6-8) are leaves — they
# can fall individually without cascading.
