terms:

  - key: valley-of-death
    pattern: "valley of death"
    section: intro
    shared: false
    definition: >
      The gap between research demonstration and commercial viability where
      promising technologies fail to transition into products. Named by analogy
      to the military term for exposed terrain between two defensible positions —
      in this case, the terrain between public research funding and private
      investment.

  - key: trl
    pattern: "Technology Readiness Levels"
    section: "01"
    shared: false
    definition: >
      A 1–9 maturity scale developed at NASA in 1974 to assess how close a
      technology is to operational deployment. TRL 1 is "basic principles
      observed"; TRL 9 is "proven in operational environment." Widely adopted
      across defense, energy, and R&D management as a standardized progress
      metric.

  - key: stage-gate
    pattern: "Stage-gate processes"
    section: "01"
    shared: false
    definition: >
      A product development methodology created by Robert G. Cooper in which
      projects pass through a series of stages separated by management review
      "gates." At each gate, a go/no-go decision determines whether the project
      advances. Designed to reduce risk on incremental innovations.

  - key: legibility
    pattern: "legibility"
    section: "01"
    shared: true
    definition: >
      James C. Scott's term for the process by which complex, locally-adapted
      systems are simplified into standardized forms that central authorities can
      read and manage. The simplification enables control but destroys the
      informal, contextual knowledge that makes the system actually work.
      Scott's canonical examples: cadastral surveys, scientific forestry,
      Soviet collectivization.

  - key: cadastral-survey
    pattern: "cadastral survey"
    section: "01"
    shared: false
    definition: >
      A comprehensive register of property boundaries and ownership created by
      a state for taxation. In Scott's analysis, the cadastral survey is the
      paradigmatic legibility project: it makes land ownership visible to the
      state but erases the informal use-rights, commons arrangements, and
      seasonal access patterns that actually govern how people use the land.

  - key: metis
    pattern: "mētis"
    section: "01"
    shared: true
    definition: >
      Greek term adopted by James C. Scott for the practical, contextual
      knowledge that comes from experience rather than formal rules. The
      craftsman's feel for the material, the farmer's read on the soil, the
      researcher's intuition for which results will generalize. Mētis is
      precisely what legibility projects destroy — it resists codification
      by nature.

  - key: goldwater-nichols
    pattern: "Goldwater-Nichols Act"
    section: "02"
    shared: false
    definition: >
      The 1986 U.S. defense reorganization law that mandated joint operations
      across military services. Before Goldwater-Nichols, each service planned
      independently and "deconflicted" afterward — a sequential process that
      produced coordination failures like the 1980 Desert One hostage rescue
      disaster. The Act required joint planning and made joint duty a career
      advancement requirement.

  - key: trading-zones
    pattern: "trading zones"
    section: "04"
    shared: true
    definition: >
      Peter Galison's concept for spaces where groups with genuinely different
      conceptual frameworks manage to collaborate without resolving their
      underlying disagreements. They develop local "pidgins" — simplified shared
      vocabularies — and coordinate through material practices and shared
      artifacts rather than shared beliefs. The trading zone enables exchange
      across incommensurable paradigms.

  - key: boundary-objects
    pattern: "boundary objects"
    section: "04"
    shared: true
    definition: >
      Susan Leigh Star and James Griesemer's term for artifacts that are
      "plastic enough to adapt to local needs and constraints of the several
      parties employing them, yet robust enough to maintain a common identity
      across sites." A prototype is a boundary object: researchers see a proof
      of concept, product leaders see a feature demo, engineers see a system
      architecture. Same artifact, different readings, productive coordination.

  - key: prfaq
    pattern: "PR/FAQ"
    section: "04"
    shared: false
    definition: >
      Amazon's internal planning document format. A fictional press release
      announcing the finished product, followed by frequently asked questions
      addressing objections from engineering, business, finance, and customers.
      Functions as a coupling device when written cross-functionally — forces
      simultaneous articulation of technical feasibility, customer value, and
      business viability within a single narrative.

  - key: coupling-device
    pattern: "coupling device"
    section: "04"
    shared: true
    definition: >
      This essay's term for a mechanism that prevents the decomposition of a
      coupled problem into uncoupled subproblems. A coupling device forces
      joint evaluation of interdependent questions — technical feasibility,
      market viability, production readiness — within a single process, rather
      than assessing each sequentially with the others' outputs treated as fixed.

  - key: heilmeier-catechism
    pattern: "Heilmeier Catechism"
    section: "04"
    shared: false
    definition: >
      A set of questions that every DARPA program manager must answer before
      a program is funded, named after former DARPA director George Heilmeier.
      The questions force articulation of goals, approach, risks, cost, and —
      critically — "Who cares?" and "Who will take the technologies and turn
      them into a capability or product?" Embeds demand-side evaluation into
      research funding from the start.

  - key: patronage-model
    pattern: "patronage model"
    section: "05"
    shared: false
    definition: >
      As used in this essay: a funding structure where research is sponsored by
      operational business units that fund the work they want to consume.
      Resources flow proportional to near-term service value, not strategic
      potential. Captures integration benefits but has no structural protection
      for research that exceeds what current sponsors can evaluate.

  - key: 5r-framework
    pattern: "5R Framework"
    section: "05"
    shared: false
    definition: >
      AstraZeneca's drug development decision framework requiring joint
      evaluation of five dimensions before committing resources: the Right
      target, Right tissue, Right safety, Right patient, and Right commercial
      potential. Changed AstraZeneca's success rate from 4% to 23% by
      forcing coupled assessment rather than sequential stage-gate evaluation.

  - key: pasteurs-quadrant
    pattern: "Pasteur's Quadrant"
    section: "06"
    shared: false
    definition: >
      Donald Stokes's concept for research that is simultaneously motivated by
      fundamental understanding and practical use — named after Pasteur, whose
      microbiology work was both basic science and directly applicable. Contrasts
      with Bohr's Quadrant (pure basic research) and Edison's Quadrant (pure
      applied). The term identifies researchers who bridge the research-product
      divide by operating in both modes simultaneously.

  - key: fraunhofer-model
    pattern: "Fraunhofer model"
    section: "07"
    shared: false
    definition: >
      The institutional design of Germany's Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, Europe's
      largest applied research organization. The key mechanism is a 30/70
      funding split: 30% government base funding protects exploratory work,
      70% contract research forces industry orientation. This creates permanent
      dual orientation without requiring anyone to identify the "switching point"
      for individual projects.

  - key: eroams-law
    pattern: "Eroom's Law"
    section: sources
    shared: false
    definition: >
      The observation that drug discovery costs roughly double every nine years
      (adjusted for inflation), despite improvements in technology. Named as
      "Moore's Law" spelled backward. Coined by Jack Scannell and colleagues
      in 2012. Suggests that increasing scientific complexity and regulatory
      burden outpace methodological improvements in pharma R&D.

    summary: >
      The canonical articulation of the "funding gap" hypothesis. Argues that
      the primary barrier to technology transfer is insufficient private capital
      at the transition from research demonstration (TRL 4–5) to commercial
      prototype (TRL 7–8). Proposes government bridge-funding mechanisms to
      close the gap. Shaped two decades of U.S. innovation policy.
    context: >
      This is the diagnosis the essay argues against. The funding-gap framing
      is empirically weak — the money arrives, the transitions still don't
      happen. The problem is structural, not financial.

    summary: >
      Empirical analysis finding the valley-of-death funding gap perception
      "inconsistent with empirical evidence." Argues that the gap narrative
      persists because it serves the interests of intermediaries (tech transfer
      offices, incubators, venture funds) who benefit from framing the problem
      as financial.
    context: >
      Key evidence against the funding-gap diagnosis. If the gap isn't
      primarily financial, the standard policy interventions (bridge funds,
      SBIR grants) are targeting the wrong cause.

    summary: >
      Argues that government funding of basic research paradoxically creates
      the valley of death by inflating early-stage output beyond what private
      markets will absorb. More public R&D funding produces more research
      results, but the commercialization pipeline doesn't scale proportionally —
      widening the gap rather than closing it.
    context: >
      A counterintuitive finding that inverts the standard policy logic: more
      funding for research can make the transition problem worse, not better.

      Analysis of European technology transfer programs finding that even where
      governments increased financing for the valley-of-death phase, "the
      challenge of crossing it and securing first major commercialisation
      investment persists." Concludes that funding alone is insufficient —
      structural and institutional factors dominate.
    context: >
      European evidence corroborating the essay's thesis. Multiple countries
      tried the funding-gap fix. It didn't work.

    summary: >
      Empirical study surveying practitioners across seven organizations.
      Identified fifteen critical shortcomings of TRL. Top-ranked problems were
      structural: TRL cannot distinguish critical from non-critical components,
      cannot assess integration maturity separate from component readiness, and
      cannot account for parallel development paths. Found that TRL's
      sophistication "gradually diminished as its usage spread outside its
      original context."
    context: >
      The most rigorous empirical critique of TRL. Confirms the essay's claim
      that TRL is a legibility tool that destroys the information practitioners
      actually need.

    summary: >
      Original articulation of the stage-gate methodology for product
      development. Projects pass through stages separated by management review
      gates with go/no-go criteria. Cooper later acknowledged that the
      approach makes overlapping stages "all but impossible" — conceding the
      sequential-evaluation limitation this essay identifies.
    context: >
      Cooper's own acknowledgment that stage-gate forces sequential evaluation
      is significant — the methodology's creator recognized the structural
      limitation.

    summary: >
      Argues that modern states impose legibility on complex local systems —
      standardized surnames, cadastral maps, scientific forestry, planned cities
      — to enable centralized management. The simplification enables control but
      destroys the informal adaptive capacity (mētis) that makes systems
      actually work. Case studies span Prussian forestry, Soviet collectivization,
      Brasília's urban planning, and Tanzanian villagization.
    context: >
      Provides the theoretical backbone of this essay. The claim that TRL is a
      Scottian legibility project — and that the valley of death is a legibility
      problem — is the essay's central original contribution.

    summary: >
      Demonstrated that making compiler checkpointing decisions aware of
      downstream fusion opportunities improves throughput by 12% and enables
      up to 1.75× larger batch sizes. The gains come entirely from reasoning
      about interaction effects between passes — not from better individual
      optimization.
    context: >
      Technical evidence for the coupled-questions thesis. Even in compiler
      optimization, sequential evaluation of interdependent decisions loses
      measurable value.

      Meta-analysis finding an average 11% cost reduction from integrated
      supply chain planning versus sequential planning — not from better
      individual decisions but from capturing the coupling between production,

      Found that commercial viability explains 39% of innovation success
      variance, and organizational performance improves 71% when companies
      navigate the valley of death through appropriate operational structures.
      Structural design matters more than funding, talent, or executive
      attention.

    summary: >
      Historical study of how experimental physicists, theoretical physicists,
      and instrument engineers collaborated despite genuinely incommensurable
      paradigms. Introduces the concept of "trading zones" — local spaces where
      groups develop simplified shared vocabularies (pidgins, then creoles) to
      coordinate without resolving their deep epistemic differences. Argues
      that science progresses through material coordination, not theoretical
      consensus.
    context: >
      Provides the key concept for the essay's proposed solution. Trading zones
      are how research and product teams can coordinate without requiring either
      side to fully adopt the other's evaluative framework.

    summary: >
      Introduces the concept of "boundary objects" — artifacts that maintain
      coherent identity across communities while being interpreted differently
      by each. Studies how Berkeley's natural history museum coordinated
      professional scientists, amateur collectors, and administrators through
      shared forms, maps, and specimens that each group used for different
      purposes.
    context: >
      The boundary object concept explains why the PR/FAQ works: it's an
      artifact that researchers, product leaders, and executives all read
      differently but can coordinate around.

      Fuji-Xerox achieved faster development through concurrent engineering.

    context: >
      Critical constraint on the essay's thesis. Coupling devices and trading
      zones aren't sufficient — someone must actually want the output. Legibility
      without demand is an essay with no reader.

      History of Bell Labs during its peak creative period. Documents how
      AT&T's monopoly position enabled sustained basic research investment
      without commercial pressure — effectively a permanent protection phase.
      Bell Labs produced the transistor, information theory, Unix, C, and the
      laser. The institutional structure that enabled this was destroyed by
      the 1984 AT&T breakup.
    context: >
      Historical case of what maximum research protection looks like. Bell
      Labs' structure was the opposite of a patronage model — researchers had
      essentially unlimited freedom. The tradeoff: brilliant research, weak
      commercialization of many inventions.

      Econometric study finding that the 1984 Bell System breakup increased
      overall innovation, even though it reduced Bell Labs' research output.
      The breakup forced formerly protected research into competitive markets,
      increasing commercialization rates enough to more than compensate for
      reduced basic research volume.
    context: >
      Complicates the protection thesis. Breaking the monopoly protection
      destroyed some basic research capacity but improved overall
      research-to-product transition — a natural experiment in the
      protection-versus-integration tradeoff.

    summary: >
      Study of "Pasteur's Quadrant" researchers — people who both publish
      papers and file patents. Found they produce work that is more novel and
      more influential than single-activity researchers, with their numbers
      increasing 350% since 1980. However, they concentrate in wealthy
      geographic areas and remain rare (14% of inventors, 4% of scientists).
    context: >
      Quantitative evidence that boundary-spanning individuals exist and
      outperform — but the conditions that produce them are institutionally
      fragile. You can't just hire your way to a trading zone.

      Early empirical analysis of the valley of death in technology transfer.
      Identified organizational and communication barriers as primary obstacles,
      predating the funding-gap consensus that Branscomb & Auerswald would
      establish a year later.
    context: >
      Part of the foundational valley-of-death literature. Notable for
      identifying organizational (not financial) barriers before the
      funding-gap narrative became dominant.

      Econometric studies finding that the presence of a Fraunhofer institute
      boosts patent output of local firms by at least 13%. The effect operates
      through knowledge spillovers and the dual-orientation researchers that
      the 30/70 funding model produces.
    context: >
      Quantitative evidence that the Fraunhofer model's structural design
      produces measurable innovation output — the funding split creates
      boundary-spanners by default.
