terms:

  # ─── SCIENCE (badge: SCIENCE, color: var(--teal)) ───

  - key: interoception
    pattern: "interoceptive signals"
    section: "01"
    definition: >
      The sense of the body's internal state — heart rate, breathing,
      gut feelings, muscle tension. A distinct sensory pathway, not
      reducible to emotion or proprioception. Accuracy varies between
      individuals and is trainable.

  - key: insular-cortex
    pattern: "insular cortex mapping"
    section: "01"
    definition: >
      The insular cortex is the brain region that maps interoceptive
      signals into conscious awareness. Bud Craig's research showed it
      constructs a moment-by-moment representation of the body's
      physiological condition — the neural basis of "how you feel."

  - key: affect-labeling
    pattern: "affect labeling"
    section: "05"
    definition: >
      The act of putting a feeling into words. Neuroimaging shows this
      activates right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and downregulates
      amygdala reactivity — a specific regulatory mechanism distinct
      from cognitive reappraisal or suppression. The effect is stronger
      with more granular labels.

  - key: emotional-granularity
    pattern: "emotional granularity"
    section: "05"
    definition: >
      The ability to make fine-grained distinctions between emotional
      states — distinguishing irritated from frustrated from exasperated.
      Higher granularity predicts better emotion regulation, fewer
      maladaptive coping strategies, and lower depression risk. It is
      trainable through practice.

  - key: hrv
    pattern: "heart rate variability"
    section: "02"
    definition: >
      The variation in time between successive heartbeats. Higher HRV
      generally indicates greater autonomic flexibility and stress
      resilience. HRV drops reliably before conscious anxiety registers,
      making it a useful biometric marker for interoceptive lead time.

  - key: constructed-emotion
    pattern: "constructed emotion theory"
    section: "02"
    definition: >
      Lisa Feldman Barrett's framework: emotions are not hardwired
      circuits triggered by stimuli, but predictions constructed by the
      brain from interoceptive signals, prior experience, and context.
      Emotion categories are learned, not innate — which means they can
      be refined through practice.

  - key: maia-2
    pattern: "MAIA-2"
    section: "05"
    definition: >
      Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness, version 2.
      A validated 37-item self-report questionnaire measuring eight
      dimensions of interoceptive awareness including noticing, attention
      regulation, emotional awareness, and trusting. The standard
      research instrument for measuring interoceptive development.

  - key: bio-behavioral-synchrony
    pattern: "bio-behavioral synchrony"
    section: "09"
    definition: >
      Ruth Feldman's framework for how biological and behavioral rhythms
      align between individuals in close contact. Documented in
      mother-infant dyads (heart rate synchrony), romantic partners
      (respiratory coupling), and therapist-client pairs. The
      physiological basis for co-regulation.

  - key: polyvagal
    pattern: "Polyvagal theory"
    section: "09"
    definition: >
      Stephen Porges's theory linking autonomic nervous system states
      to social engagement. Influential in therapy and somatic practice,
      but faces empirical criticism — particularly the claim that the
      ventral vagal branch mediates social engagement independently.
      The core insight (autonomic state shapes social capacity) is
      better supported than the specific neural mechanism proposed.

  # ─── PRODUCT (badge: PRODUCT, color: var(--accent)) ───

  - key: frame-snap
    pattern: "Frame Snap"
    section: "02"
    definition: >
      Notice's core interaction. A single tap on the Watch or phone
      captures a biometric snapshot (heart rate, HRV, context) at
      the moment you notice an internal shift. The tap is both a data
      capture event and a micro-intervention — the act of noticing
      is itself regulatory.

  - key: scaffolding-decay
    pattern: "Scaffolding decay"
    section: "06"
    definition: >
      The deliberate, progressive reduction of app support as the user
      develops independent interoceptive capacity. Reflections, suggestions,
      and biometric displays fade in three phases (full → reduced → minimal)
      triggered by behavioral signals and confirmed by the user.

  - key: interoceptive-lead-time
    pattern: "interoceptive lead time"
    section: "05"
    definition: >
      The temporal gap between when your body shifts (measurable via
      biometrics) and when you consciously register the shift (measured
      by a Frame Snap). Shrinking this gap is the primary training
      outcome Notice measures. As far as we can determine, no other
      product captures both data streams needed to compute it.

  - key: lora
    pattern: "LoRA adaptation"
    section: "07"
    definition: >
      Low-Rank Adaptation — a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique
      that learns a small set of weights on top of a frozen base model.
      On-device LoRA means the personalization layer stays on the phone:
      the model learns your vocabulary and patterns without transmitting
      training data.

  - key: app-attest
    pattern: "App Attest"
    section: "04"
    definition: >
      Apple's device attestation service. Generates cryptographic
      assertions proving a request originates from a legitimate,
      unmodified copy of the app running on genuine Apple hardware.
      Notice uses it to validate device identity before the Cloudflare
      proxy forwards any API request.

  - key: focusing
    pattern: "Focusing tradition"
    section: "02"
    definition: >
      Eugene Gendlin's therapeutic method centered on attending to the
      "felt sense" — the body's holistic, pre-verbal knowing about a
      situation. Gendlin found that therapy clients who naturally
      referenced felt sense showed better outcomes. Notice's emotion
      taxonomy is grounded in this somatic orientation.

    pattern: "Bud Craig's"
    section: "01"
    title: "How Do You Feel? Interoception: The Sense of the Physiological Condition of the Body"
    authors: "A.D. (Bud) Craig"
    year: 2002
    venue: "Nature Reviews Neuroscience 3(8), 655–666"
    url: "https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn894"
    summary: >
      The foundational paper mapping interoception as a distinct sensory
      pathway through the insular cortex. Established that the brain
      maintains a real-time map of the body's physiological state, and
      that conscious access to this map varies between individuals.
    context: >
      This is the neuroscience anchor for Notice's core claim: that
      interoceptive accuracy is a trainable skill, not a fixed trait.

  - key: lieberman-2007
    pattern: "Lieberman et al. (2007)"
    section: "02"
    title: "Putting Feelings into Words: Affect Labeling Disrupts Amygdala Activity in Response to Affective Stimuli"
    authors: "Matthew D. Lieberman, Naomi I. Eisenberger, Molly J. Crockett, Sabrina M. Tom, Jennifer H. Pfeifer, & Baldwin M. Way"
    year: 2007
    venue: "Psychological Science 18(5), 421–428"
    url: "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01916.x"
    summary: >
      Demonstrated via fMRI that labeling an emotional face image
      with a word reduces amygdala activation and increases right
      VLPFC activation. The regulatory effect is implicit — participants
      don't intend to regulate, yet labeling itself downregulates
      the emotional response.
    context: >
      The neuroscience basis for why every Frame Snap is a
      micro-intervention, not just a data capture event.

  - key: barrett-2017
    pattern: "Barrett's"
    section: "02"
    title: "How Emotions Are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain"
    authors: "Lisa Feldman Barrett"
    year: 2017
    venue: "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"
    url: "https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/how-emotions-are-made/"
    summary: >
      The book-length argument for constructed emotion theory: emotions
      are not triggered reactions but predictions the brain constructs
      from interoceptive signals, prior experience, and conceptual
      knowledge. Emotion categories are culturally learned, not
      biologically innate.
    context: >
      Grounds Notice's deepest design constraint — the app treats
      emotion labels as frames, not facts.

  - key: feldman-2007
    pattern: "Feldman's"
    section: "09"
    title: "Parent–Infant Synchrony: Biological Foundations and Developmental Outcomes"
    authors: "Ruth Feldman"
    year: 2007
    venue: "Current Directions in Psychological Science 16(6), 340–345"
    url: "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00532.x"
    summary: >
      Established bio-behavioral synchrony as a framework for
      parent-infant interaction: heart rate, gaze, affect, and
      arousal patterns align between caregiver and infant in
      structured ways that predict developmental outcomes.
    context: >
      The research basis for Notice's relational attunement tier —
      the claim that physiological synchrony is measurable and
      meaningful between individuals.

  - key: fda-wellness
    pattern: "FDA's General Wellness Guidance"
    section: "04"
    title: "General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices"
    authors: "U.S. Food and Drug Administration"
    year: 2019
    venue: "FDA Guidance Document"
    url: "https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/general-wellness-policy-low-risk-devices"
    summary: >
      Defines the regulatory boundary for wellness products. A device
      qualifies as "general wellness" if it (1) is low risk and (2)
      makes only general wellness claims, not disease-specific claims.
      One diagnostic-sounding phrase can shift a product from unregulated
      wellness to FDA-regulated medical device.
    context: >
      Why Notice's language is carefully constrained — the regulatory
      classification depends on what the app says, not just what it
      measures.

    year: 2023
    venue: "16 CFR Part 318 (amended)"
    url: "https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/health-breach-notification-rule"
    summary: >
      Requires vendors of personal health records to notify consumers
      and the FTC following a breach of unsecured health information.
      Applies to apps that combine biometric data with health-related
      self-reports — which includes Notice. Penalties up to $53,000 per
      violation per day.
    context: >
      The compliance reason Notice's privacy architecture is non-negotiable,
      not just a feature.

    summary: >
      A contemplative community and pedagogy integrating jhāna
      (deep meditative absorption) practice with modern psychotherapy
      and relational work. Notice's beta testers come from this
      community, and its pedagogical orientation — relation over
      object, felt sense over diagnosis — is a core design constraint.
